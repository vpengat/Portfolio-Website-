Hi! 👋 I'm Vignesh, a Computer Science student passionate about technology, problem-solving and building things that make sense. This website is my personal space on the internet — a place where you can learn a bit about me, my background and the projects I've worked on.

###  My Featured Projects:

####  Grocery Price Checker (In Progress)
I’m building a Python tool that scrapes weekly flyers from stores, compares prices and shows people the cheapest options. I'm using **Python, Pandas, SQL** and **Power BI** to make it both useful and visual.

####  This Portfolio Website
I designed and developed this from scratch using **React**. It’s clean, responsive and built to grow as I do. It reflects my skills, personality and work ethic.

####  CETC Marketing Project
Worked remotely on a paid project for **Canada Education Technology College**. I created marketing content, researched trends and even produced YouTube videos — combining creativity, research and communication.

###  Why I Built This

I’m working toward a career in **technical program management** and **product roles** — and this portfolio reflects that.

To me, being a PM or TPM means:
- Explaining ideas clearly  
- Building trust across teams  
- Turning goals into action plans  
- Constantly learning and improving

" fail a lot, but fail fast "
